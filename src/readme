ShopzPlugin by babrs

about:
    This plugin enables you to deploy dynamic User- and AdminServers for trading Stacks of up to 64 Items.
    You are able to open shops with renamed Item Frames (just use an anvil and rename a stack of Item Frames to whatever
    is specified in config.yml/frame_name ("$shop" per default).
    AdminShops can be created by using the "/shopz admin" command and using the resulting Item Frame as previously explained.
    These can buy and sell Items without having actual stock for your Players.

usage:
    generating ShopTokens to setup user shops:
        Take a Stack of Item Frames (amount does not matter, higher amount will be more expensive)
        Place the Item Frames in an anvil
        Rename the Item Frames to whatever is specified in config.yml/frame_name ("$shop" per default)
        Take the Item out of the result slot, this will not cost any experience
        This may cost you some amount of currency, depending on the settings in config.yml/frame_cost_money multiplied by
        the amount of Item Frames you just renamed
        When you destroy a User-Shop, the attached ShopTokens will drop, making them reusable
    generating AdminShopTokens:
        Use the command "/shopz admin" to generate an (one) AdminShopToken, it will be created in your inventory, should
        there be enough space
    setting up a shop:
        crouch and place any ShopToken at any container (chests, doublechests, barrels, dispensers, hoppers, brewing stands,...
        the setup inventory will open up for both, admin- and user shops
        click on the buttons on the left (structure void) to increase or decrease the price that Players can buy items at
        the store
        click on the buttons on the left (barrier) to increase or decrease the price that Players can sell items at the
        store
        place any item (including potions, enchanted items, enchanted books,...) in the middlemost slot, this will display
        that items material, it's amount and it's enchantments, but cleanse it's display name, this will be the item traded
        at the shop
        note: Players can only buy/sell the item, if it has the exact same enchantments and effects (for potions), armor
        and weapons can only be traded, if their durability is full
        for a user shop, the price at which you sell to players has to be greater than the price at which you (as owner)
        buy from players, for an admin shop both can be equal, but the selling price cannot be greater than the buying
        price
        if you do not enter a selling price, the item can only be bought, but not sold by other players
        close the setup-inventory, this will (if all inputs are valid) create an Item Frame with a copy of the item you're
        planning to trade there
        you can place multiple Item Frames at the same container, but this will only create duplicates of the first one,
        thus you are only able to trade one item per block
    reconfiguring the shop:
        rightclick on a user- shop if you are it's owner, this will reopen the setup-menu, enabling you to tweak it's
        settings
        for admin shops you have to remove the Item Frame and place a new one (as admin shops do not drop AdminShopTokens)
    trading:
        rightclick an user- or admin shop's Item Frame
        this will open up a shopping menu
        leftclick the structure void item to buy a copy of the item in the middlemost slot for the buying price specified
        leftclick the barrier item to buy a copy of the item in the middlemost slot for the buying price specified
        shift-leftclick either of both to execute the same action 5-times
    closing a shop:
        leftclick (attack) the shop if you are it's owner, this will destroy it
    further help:
        use the "/shopz help" command to list every subcommand you are allowed to execute and get information about that
        command
